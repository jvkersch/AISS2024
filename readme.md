# AI Summer School 2024  
Organized by Ho-min Park (Ph.D. Student, Ghent University)

We are excited to announce the GUGC AI Winter School 2024, following the success of our AI Summer School 2023. This Winter School is an intensive 6-week program from January 5th to February 18th, focused on advancing knowledge and practical skills in artificial intelligence (AI). Our goal is to provide a strong learning environment where participants can develop and refine their AI projects.

This schedule offered a structured approach to learning various AI topics, allowing participants to gradually build their knowledge and skills.

### Self-Study and Project Development (July 20th - August 15th)

After the initial two weeks, participants had a four-week self-study period, where they worked on their AI projects individually or in teams. This phase encouraged participants to apply what they had learned to practical challenges, promoting innovation and creativity.

### Final Presentation (August 27th - 28th)

The program ended with a two-day presentation seminar on August 27th and 28th, where each participant or team showcased their project outcomes. This seminar allowed for the exchange of ideas, feedback, and recognition of the hard work and achievements of all involved.

## Target Audience

The Winter School was designed for undergraduate students at GUGC who wanted to deepen their understanding and skills in artificial intelligence. This program aimed to include students from various disciplines within GUGC, giving them the opportunity to explore AI concepts and apply them to real-world scenarios. Whether participants were beginners in AI or had some foundational knowledge, this Winter School was designed to enhance their learning experience and prepare them for future academic or industry challenges in AI.

## Instructors

The GUGC AI Winter School 2024 featured a group of instructors who were students in the previous year's Beginner group and had since advanced in their AI knowledge. These students led lectures and practical sessions alongside experienced academics and industry experts. This structure enriched the learning experience with fresh perspectives and showed the path from learner to leader in AI.

Details on the names, backgrounds, and lecture topics of these student instructors, as well as the professional experts they collaborated with, were provided to give participants a comprehensive overview of the diverse expertise available during the Winter School.
